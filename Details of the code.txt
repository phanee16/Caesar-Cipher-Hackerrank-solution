The time complexity of the given code is O(n), where n is the length of the input string. This is because the code iterates over each character in the input string once, performs a constant amount of work on each character, and then returns the encrypted string.

The space complexity of the given code is also O(n). This is because the code creates a new string of the same length as the input string to store the encrypted string. The code also uses a constant amount of extra space for the variables n and k. Therefore, the total space required by the code is proportional to the length of the input string.
